This section describes a process that can be used to create tiled image
pyramids to be used with WorldWide Telescope. A sample implementation of
the interfaces and methods is included, and if your source data matches this
closely then the sample code provided should work in full or in part for the
task. If there are significant differences between the source data used in the
samples and the source data you have, then this document should be used to
describe a template for implementing the appropriate interfaces and methods.

{% note(html=1) %}
The Windows Tile Pyramid SDK is not actively maintained. The currently
recommended tool for creating WWT tile pyramids is the <a
href="https://toasty.readthedocs.io/">toasty</a> Python package.
