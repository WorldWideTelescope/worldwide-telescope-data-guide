To run the SDK ensure your system meets the hardware requirements and the
necessary software is installed, described in the
[Getting Started](worldwidetelescopesdkgettingstarted.html) section.

# Installation

To install the SDK run the MSI package. This will install the source code,
samples, documentation, and the SDK libraries, by default to the following
location:

```
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Research\WorldWide Telescope SDK\Tile Pyramid SDK
```

Note that under **Source Code** there are three folders; **Core** containing
the interfaces and classes described below, **Samples** containing the sample
projects, and **TileGenerator** containing the Visual Studio project for the
tile generator tool.
